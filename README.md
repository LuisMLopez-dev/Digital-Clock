# Digital Clock in VHDL

There are the source files for the design of a digital clock for a seven-segment display.
This clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds in military format (no AM or PM, hours go from 1 to 24)
The Double Dabble Algorithm is used here for the conversion of binary to BCD, and this digital clock was created for a Nexys4 DDR Board.
